  Humpless: no bumps along the way.
  Our project is a simple and intuitive tool designed to help you manage your
  tasks and stay organized. Similar to Google Calendar, our app allows you to
  create, schedule, and prioritize tasks with ease. It will be implemented as
  a CLI. It can help keep track of done/in-progress/todo tasks and organize
  them by category, due date, and subtasks.
